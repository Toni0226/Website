## Setup and Execution

To set up and run this social media system on your local environment, follow these detailed steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine.
2. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code**: Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to 'File' > 'Open Folder' to select the cloned directory.
3. **Navigate to the API Folder**: In the first terminal within VSCode, change to the `api` directory by running `cd api`, install necessary dependencies with `npm install`, and start the API server by executing `npm start`, which will run on `http://localhost:8800`.
4. **Navigate to the Project Folder**: In a second terminal, switch to the `project` directory with `cd project`, install the frontend dependencies using `npm install`, and start the frontend server by running `npm start`. The frontend will then be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
5. **Access the Application**: With both servers running, the social media system is accessible via `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser, allowing you to interact with the application as intended.
